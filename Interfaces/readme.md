# Interfaces
Interfaces describe a group of related functions that can be belong to any class or struct.

In fact, Interface is a **Contract** and makes our code flexible.

### Interface Segregation Principle:
Client should not be forced to depend upon the methods they do not use. Interfaces belong to clients, not to hierarchies.
- Interfaces should only include what the calling code needs.
